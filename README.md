# CV Template Adaptation Project

## Description

Welcome to my project! This project was created as part of a coding bootcamp assignment. The objective was to fork and customize a CV template to showcase basic HTML and CSS skills. This project is designed to be beginner-friendly, focusing on foundational knowledge in HTML, Git, terminal commands, and GitHub usage.
